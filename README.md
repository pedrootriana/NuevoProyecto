# NuevoProyecto

I had never made a proyect like this, I have previously used CAD or arduino in class projects but never a complete implemented one, so this hackpad seemed like a decent idea for a first approximation to this field.
I wanted to keep it simple as i had never done anything similar, so i kept it with four keys and two leds, as in the blueprint's guided project.

## Functions

I used two layers, one for multimedia control (pause, next song, volume control), and the other for windows functions (copy, paste, multitask and undo). To swap between layers you have to hold pressed one of the keys. To show which layer you are in, I have used the colour of the leds, blue for windows and green for multimedia.

## Design



The case was made with fusion, I kept it simple, following the tutorial.

Scheme was made with kiCAD, it was my first time using it.

The PCB was also made with KiCAD.
